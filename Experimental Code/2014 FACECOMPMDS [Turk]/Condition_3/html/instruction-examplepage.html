In the present task, you will be shown faces with a range of different similarities.  For instance, an example such as the one which follows would be very similar
<br>
</br>
<img src = "stimuli/pair1.bmp" id = "pair1" width = 334 height = 126>
<br>
</br>
Consequently, this pair should receive a high rating (i.e., a 7 or an 8).  On the other hand, this pair is highly dissimilar and should receive a low rating (i.e., a 1 or 2):
<br>
</br>
<img src = "stimuli/pair2.bmp" id = "pair2" width = 334 height = 126>
<br>
</br>
Finally, this pair has a similarity somewhere in the middle of the other two and should receive a middle rating (e.g., 4 or 5)
<br>
</br>
<img src = "stimuli/pair3.bmp" id = "pair3" width = 334 height = 126>
<br>
</br>
During the course of the experiment, please try to use all of the similarity scores. That is, don't just use scores of 1 and 8, try to make your scores using the entire range of responses. 
<br>
</br>
You can use the mouse to make your response but you can also use the tab key and the left and right buttons to cycle through the choices. Use whichever is more comfortable for you.
<br>
</br>
Your goal is to respond as honestly as possible but bear in mind that the full range of similarities will be shown. Click on next to continue.
