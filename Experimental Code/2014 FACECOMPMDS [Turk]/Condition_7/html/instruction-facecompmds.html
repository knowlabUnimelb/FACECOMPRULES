This experiment investigates how people perceive similarity between pairs of faces. Each face consists of a top half and bottom half. On each trial, you will be shown a pair of faces and asked to rate how similar the two faces are on an 8-point scale. Some examples of these faces are presented below.

<img src = "stimuli/examplefaces.bmp" id = "examplefaces" width = 665 height = 125>
<br>
</br>
Least similar: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 Most similar
<br>
</br>
A similarity score of 1 indicates that the two faces are NOT SIMILAR and a score of 8 means that the two faces are VERY SIMILAR 
<br>
</br>
As you can see, the faces are similar to each other because they are all bald headed men. However, the faces you will see will be even more similar to each other than the examples shown above. We want you to rate the similarity between the faces based on both the top and bottom half of each face. Please use the entire scale so each pair should be rated relative to all of the other possible pairs. Three examples are shown on the next screen.
